SublimeFoundationSnippets
=========================

Foundation snippets for the Sublime text editor

These snippets were created to increase the speed of production when using Zurb Foundation files when using Sublime Text.

Place the snippets in your Sublime Snippets folder ie. C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User. You can then access these snippets using the first 3 letters of the item you wish to use pre-pended with the letter 'z'. Example to use a button you should use: zbut tab to activate the button snippet.

Please let me know if there is anything missing and I will do my best to add thoes snippets into this repo also.

Cheers,
Sam Chalmers
